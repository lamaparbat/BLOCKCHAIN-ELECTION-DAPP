## Introduction
Before diving into the agenda, lets know what is blockchain. In general, Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. It is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.

The purpose of the blockchain is to share information amongst all parties that access it via an application. Access to this ledger in terms of reading and writing may be unrestricted ('permissionless'), or restricted ('permissioned').

Blockchain technology was developed to address these problems, and it now provides decentralized nodes for electronic voting. Electronic voting systems are created using blockchain technology primarily because to the benefits of end-to-end verification.

## System Features
- User centered Design
- Realtime voting updates & counts
- Data Visualization
- Web 3.0
- Smart Contract

## Problems with traditional voting system.
- First and foremost, privacy and unfairity risk
- Large amount of manpower (Myadi police) required & cost aswell.
- Citizen outside the country cannot vote their favourite ones.
- Voter might be stand on the queue for long time and very difficulty for the old age citizens
- Voting result might takes long time to publish

## Advantages of decentralized voting system
-> All above traditional voting system drawbacks can overcome with blockchain technology.

## Disadvantages of decentralized voting system
- The reason blockchain is a highly secure system is the ledger is public. All past transactions can be seen by anyone who works the system, and they can’t be changed because everyone will notice. That doesn’t work in a voting system where secret ballot is mandated. Every transaction is identifiable.
